In this work, we demonstrate the robustness and versatility of scEmbed, a new tool for the analysis of scATAC-seq data. scEmbed differs from existing methods in that instead of learning embeddings of individual cells directly, it first learns embeddings of genomic regulatory regions and then uses these to compute cell embeddings. We demonstrate how this approach allows scEmbed to use pre-trained genomic region embedding models to effectively cluster data not seen by the model. Our evaluation of scEmbed against existing scATAC-seq methodologies demonstrates its efficacy and competitiveness, even with a relatively simple network architecture. scEmbed performs well, even when faced with severe data loss. The standout feature of scEmbed is its capability to repurpose learned region embeddings for downstream analysis tasks.

This approach provides flexibility and efficiency, setting it apart from other currently available tools. By exploiting region overlaps and applying previously learned region embeddings, we have formulated a novel method for representing unseen scATAC-seq data within the latent space of the original training data. This process, termed 'projection', yielded superb clustering of cells, showing no significant decrease in performance compared with models trained entirely on the new dataset. This performance underscores the potential of scEmbed in the context of ATAC-seq transfer learning tasks and opens up exciting possibilities for future research. Moreover, we emphasize the novelty of scEmbed in its ability to engage in transfer learning without the need for another data modality like scRNA-seq, which overwhelmingly required by current methods. Future studies will explore the ability of our model to learn and extract overarching regulatory patterns from publicly available data. This learning, coupled with the inherent transferability of scEmbed, will empower researchers to fine-tune the models for specific downstream tasks, enabling gains in performance, efficiency, and flexibility.

Finally, we leveraged embeddings computed by scEmbed and its pre-trained models to build a novel cell-type annotation system. Our method is consistent with current scATAC-seq cell-type annotation implementations, with the added advantage of requiring no external data modalities. Furthermore, by exploiting pre-trained models and pre-computed cell embeddings from reference datasets, the scEmbed annotation system can easily scale to millions of cells and uses only a fraction of the compute time. This is because utilization of a pre-trained model requires only interval overlap analysis to map the new data into the feature space on which the model was trained. We have made the pre-trained models used in this study available for download and use on huggingface. To facilitate model sharing and usability even further @Xue2023, we have built software packages to easily download and use these models within Python. Moreover, these same packages can be used to train new models or fine-tune public ones on custom datasets. We hope that these resources will enable researchers to leverage the power of scEmbed for their own research.

The integration of unsupervised learning with transfer learning may offer new directions for other bioinformatics tasks that are similarly burdened by the challenges of high dimensionality and data sparsity. Furthermore, the deployment of pre-trained models for reference datasets may inspire novel methodologies for efficient and accurate cell-type annotation systems across different data modalities. In the future, the pre-training approach of scEmbed could be adapted for use with cross-modality methods that span data types @Gharavi2024. In conclusion, scEmbed's ability to distill meaningful representations from vast, complex scATAC-seq datasets, and repurpose this knowledge for rapid and accurate analysis of new datasets, has great potential. This work is a step towards developing more efficient, scalable, and flexible tools for genomic data analysis. The opportunities unlocked by scEmbed for research and clinical application promise exciting advancements in the comprehension of cellular heterogeneity and the intricate regulatory networks that drive it.
