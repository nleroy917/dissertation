This dissertation advances the field of scATAC-seq analysis in three distinct ways:

First, it introduces a novel tokenization framework for training and running scATAC-seq models, along with a suite of high-performance, Rust-based infrastructure to support these methods, including vocabulary builders and fast tokenizers designed to enable highly efficient and scalable data processing.

Second, it presents scEmbed, a shallow neural network based on Word2Vec that follows the discrete token approach proposed in previous sections to first assess the feasibility of tokenized chromatin accessibility modeling. This provides a proof-of-concept for model sharing and the re-use of pre-trained genomic region embeddings, thereby streamlining downstream analysis and reducing computational overhead. We show that pre-trained region embeddings learned with scEmbed can be effectively utilized in various downstream tasks, improving performance and reducing the need for extensive retraining.

Finally, it develops Atacformer, a transformer-based foundation model for chromatin accessibility that incorporates our novel tokenization strategy and pushes the discrete token approach to its limit, analyzing its ability to extract meaningful biological insights at the single-region level. This design emphasizes flexibility and efficiency, achieving comparable performance with dramatically fewer parameters than existing approaches. Moreover, our new infrastructure facilitates easier model sharing and deployment and our discrete token framework enables biological insights and interpretability to discover regulatory mechanisms. Together, these contributions provide both methodological foundations and practical tools that move the field toward unified, generalizable models for single-cell epigenomic analysis.
