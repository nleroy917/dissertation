There are too many people for which I am grateful who got me to this point -- I could not possibly list them all. However, I would like to specifically acknowledge a few key individuals.

First, my advisor, Dr. Nathan Sheffield, for his amazing guidance and support throughout my PhD journey. His mentorship has been invaluable, and his passion for science is truly inspiring.

To Barnabas, my closest friend. Your unwavering support, encouragement, and friendship have meant the world to me. Thank you for always being there through the ups and downs. It feels like only yesterday we were discussing our dreams and aspirations at Purdue, and now here we are.

To Alex and Donald, my labmates and friends. Your camaraderie and collaboration have made this journey so enjoyable and fulfilling. Thank you for the countless discussions, brainstorming sessions, and shared experiences. You've made me a better scientist, engineer, and person.

And finally, to Hannah, my partner in life. Your love, patience, and understanding have been my anchor throughout this journey. Thank you for believing in me and supporting me every step of the way. This dissertation is as much yours as it is mine.
