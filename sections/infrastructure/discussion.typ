The `gtars` and `geniml` project provides a suite of high-performance tools designed to bridge the gap between raw genomic interval data and modern machine learning workflows. We address two of the most significant bottlenecks in the field: the ad hoc nature of vocabulary creation and the inefficiency of tokenization.

First, by providing `uniwig`, we establish a systematic and reproducible foundation for building consensus genomic interval sets. This high-performance pre-processing engine enables the practical application of sophisticated universe construction methods, such as the LH and HMM approaches. This moves the field beyond simplistic merging or binning strategies and toward the creation of robust, biologically meaningful vocabularies that are tailored for machine learning applications.

Second, the `gtars-tokenizers` library provides the critical link between these vocabularies and the ML ecosystem. Its fast, unified interface makes it easy to integrate into popular ML packages like Hugging Face and PyTorch, and it is also highly useful for traditional applications of interval overlap arithmetic. By providing a fast, ML-aware abstraction, `gtars-tokenizers` helps move the field beyond tool-specific pipelines toward interoperable, general-purpose models of genome function.

Together, these components create a synergistic workflow. Principled vocabularies are of little use without an efficient tool to map to them, and a high-performance tokenizer is ineffective without a well-defined vocabulary. New tools like `gtars` that address the full pipeline will be an important part of the evolving ecosystem that promotes fast, reproducible analysis on genomic regions. Future work that extends this entire approach—from universe creation to tokenization—to other data types like fragments, AnnData objects, bulk ATAC-seq, or even SNPs could reshape how we represent and analyze the genome.
