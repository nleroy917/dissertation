The gtars-tokenizers project provides a valuable tool for ML in genomics. A fast, unified interface makes it easy to integrate into the existing popular ML packages while also being useful for traditional applications of interval overlap arithmetic. New tools like gtars will be an important part of the evolving ecosystem that promote fast analysis on genomic regions. Future work that will extend this approach to fragments, AnnData objects, bulk ATAC-seq, or even SNPs could reshape how we represent and analyze the genome. By providing a fast, ML-aware abstraction, gtars-tokenizers helps move the field beyond tool-specific pipelines toward interoperable, general-purpose models of genome function.
