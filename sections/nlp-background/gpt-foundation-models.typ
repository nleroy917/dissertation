=== Large language models and foundation models
The transformer architecture laid the groundwork for the development of large language models (LLMs), which are typically defined as transformer-based models with hundreds of millions to billions of parameters trained on massive text corpora. These models, such as OpenAI's GPT series @Brown2020 and Google's PaLM @Chowdhery2022, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating coherent text, answering questions, and performing various NLP tasks with minimal fine-tuning. The key to their success lies in their scale and the diversity of data they are trained on, which allows them to learn a wide range of linguistic patterns and knowledge.

Building on the success of LLMs, the concept of *foundation models* has emerged. Foundation models are large-scale models trained on broad data at scale and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks. They serve as a base upon which more specialized models can be built through fine-tuning or prompt engineering. The term "foundation model" emphasizes the idea that these models provide a foundational understanding of language that can be leveraged for various applications across different domains @Bommasani2022.

The development of LLMs and foundation models has also spurred interest in multimodal models that can process and generate content across different modalities, such as text, images, and audio. Examples include OpenAI's CLIP @Radford2021a and DALL-E @Ramesh2021, which combine text and image understanding to perform tasks like image generation from textual descriptions.

The advancements in LLMs and foundation models have significant implications for various fields, including bioinformatics and genomics. By leveraging the principles of transfer learning and the ability to learn from large-scale data, researchers can develop models that understand biological sequences and structures, enabling new insights and applications in areas such as gene regulation, protein folding, and drug discovery. In the following chapters, we will explore how these concepts have influenced our approach to analyzing single-cell ATAC-seq data using transformer-based architectures.
