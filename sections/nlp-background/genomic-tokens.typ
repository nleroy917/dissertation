=== Building machine learning models for genomic interval data using genomic tokens
Adapting NLP techniques to epigenomic data requires careful consideration of how to represent genomic intervals as discrete tokens. Unlike natural language, or even some biological datasets where words and tokens are well-defined units with semantic meaning, genomic _regions_ are continuous sequences of nucleotides that do not have strong inherent boundaries or meanings. Therefore, to leverage NLP models for genomic data, we need to define a suitable vocabulary and tokenization strategy.

There is a useful analogy between words in language and regions in the genome: both are building blocks that models compose to express higher-order structure. However, the analogy breaks down in important ways. First, linguistic tokens arise from shared, largely agreed-upon ontologies (morphology, lexicons, grammars) and well-understood segmentation rules. Genomic intervals, by contrast, are fluid: regulatory elements, chromatin states, and functional domains overlap, vary in size, and lack a single universally accepted partitioning. Second, linguistic tokens have an inherent order to them. Genomic regions, while ordered along chromosomes, are rarely analyzed in a temporal or strictly sequential context. Instead, their function often depends on 3D conformation, epigenetic state, and cell type, complicating the notion of "context" that NLP models typically rely on.

Deep learning models are increasingly being developed for genomic interval data, but most treat intervals as continuous signals or coordinate-derived features rather than as discrete, reusable tokens. Treating genomic regions as tokens offers substantial advantages: compact, shared vocabularies that improve parameter efficiency and transfer learning; direct alignment between model components and biological entities for clearer mechanistic interpretations; and token-level attribution and attention analyses that make model decisions more transparent. *This thesis work formalizes our proposed framework of genomic interval tokens and adapts modern NLP architectures to epigenetic data, providing a framework and model suite that deliver strong predictive performance while substantially improving interpretability enabling biological insights and reducing computational complexity over prior approaches.*
