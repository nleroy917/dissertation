This dissertation explores the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and single-cell chromatin accessibility analysis, focusing on the development of transformer-based transfer learning approaches tailored for scATAC-seq data. To contextualize this interdisciplinary approach, it is essential to establish a foundational understanding of NLP's evolution and current state. The field of NLP has undergone remarkable transformation over the past decades, progressing from rule-based systems and statistical methods to the current era of deep learning and large-scale transformer architectures. This historical progression not only illuminates the technological advances that make modern NLP applications possible but also provides crucial context for understanding how established NLP methodologies can be adapted and applied to novel domains such as genomics. By grounding this work in NLP's developmental trajectory, we can better appreciate both the opportunities and challenges inherent in transferring language processing techniques to analysis of gene regulation.
