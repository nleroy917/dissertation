== Conceptual and Methodological Insights
The central conceptual insight of this work is that genomic regions can be treated as linguistic tokens, enabling direct transfer of NLP methodologies to regulatory genomics. This framing allows the application of embedding-based and transformer architectures to high-dimensional chromatin data.

scEmbed demonstrated that static embeddings of genomic regions can capture functional and contextual information, while Atacformer extended this idea to contextual embeddings that dynamically reflect the cell's regulatory state. This shift from static to contextual representation parallels the evolution from Word2Vec to BERT in NLP—transforming what was once a static lookup table into a model capable of reasoning about meaning in context.
