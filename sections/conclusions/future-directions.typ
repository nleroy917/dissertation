== Future Directions: Roadmap for Next-Generation Genomic Foundation Models

// INTRODUCTION PARAGRAPH (3-4 sentences)
// - The work presented establishes foundation but represents early stage
// - Multiple promising directions for extension and improvement
// - This section outlines six key aims in detail, structured as research proposals
// - Each aim addresses specific limitation or opportunity identified through this work

// TRANSITION PARAGRAPH to next section (2-3 sentences)
// These six aims represent logical extensions of the work presented in this dissertation. Each builds on the foundation established by gtars, scEmbed, and Atacformer while addressing specific limitations and opportunities. Pursuing these directions will require sustained effort, collaboration, and resources—but the potential to transform how regulatory genomics is studied makes this a compelling research agenda for the coming years.
