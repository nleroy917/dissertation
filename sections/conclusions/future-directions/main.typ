// These six aims represent logical extensions of the work presented in this dissertation. Each builds on the foundation established by gtars, scEmbed, and Atacformer while addressing specific limitations and opportunities. Pursuing these directions will require sustained effort, collaboration, and resources—but the potential to transform how regulatory genomics is studied makes this a compelling research agenda for the coming years.
